# Alert-System-with-Face-Mask-Detection

#### Problem Statement:
To build an Automated Facial Mask Detection System using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to prevent Spread of Air borne diseases.

#### Project Objective:
Develop an automated system using machine learning and YOLO algorithm to detect mask-wearing and its correctness in real-time video streams in different lighting and environmental conditions.
Incorporate an integrated API to alert system administrators about individuals not following mask-wearing guidelines.
Create a reliable and accurate system that can classify new mask-wearing patterns and behaviors.
Ensure public safety during the COVID-19 pandemic by enforcing mask-wearing policies and reducing the spread of the virus.
Develop a technology that can be implemented in public and private sectors such as shopping malls, schools, airports, and train/bus stations to ensure the safety of individuals in these settings.
Use object detection techniques to tackle the issue of face mask detection and promote the importance of wearing masks to protect each other.

#### Proposed Solution:
To address the issue of identifying mask-wearing behavior in real-time, an automated face mask detection system using machine learning and the YOLO algorithm has been proposed. The YOLO algorithm was chosen as it can perform object detection in real-time, making it an ideal candidate for detecting mask-wearing behavior in live video streams. In addition, an integrated API was incorporated into the system to send alerts to system administrators whenever the system detects individuals who are not wearing masks or wearing them incorrectly.The system can be implemented in various public and private sectors such as shopping malls, schools, airports, and train and bus stations to help ensure the safety of individuals in these settings
